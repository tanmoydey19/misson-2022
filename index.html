            <h1>Padma Bridge: </h1>
            <h1 class="h2">Its huge impact on economy</h1>
            <p>
                Towards the end of 2020, the full length of Padma Bridge of our dream became visible. After installation of the 41st span of the Padma Bridge on December 10, the real specimen of the bridge now can be seen in full view. The total length of the bridge is 10.642 km. The length of the main bridge is 6.15 km and the railway viaduct is 0.532 km. River training of two kilometres of the river is being done to protect the bridge and north bank from erosion. About 13 km of river training is being done to protect the southern bank of the river i.e. Jazira side. Depending on the situation, the area of river training is likely to increase in the future.

                The 2.3 km approach road of Padma Bridge at the Mawa end and 12.8 km at the Jazira end have been constructed. Construction expenditure of Padma Bridge increases day by day. In 2007 during the tenure of Caretaker government the expenditure of Padma Bridge was estimated at Taka 10,161 crore (1.47 billion US dollars). That time road construction plan involved 5.58 km. On 6th January 2008 Awami League formed government. In January the US-New Zealand-Australia-based advisory firm Maunsell-Accom was selected for making the detailed design of the bridge

            <h3>History of Padma Bridge:</h3>
            <p>The Padma Bridge has its eventful history. We all know the historical events of its making. After hiring consultants in 2009, they started working. Development partners and lenders expressed interest in lending for the Padma Bridge project. A loan proposal was given by World Bank offering 1000 million dollars, ADB 500 million dollars, JICA 300 million dollars at very low interest rates. After talks between the bridge division and lenders the proposal for the two-storied bridge like one in Denmark was granted. Its cost was earmarked at 2.4 million dollars or 16,970 crore taka. A four-lane road will be built on the steel-based infrastructure, and under the bridge a rail line will be built. Development partners finalised the debt proposal. Papers were signed to allocate 1200 million dollars from World Bank, 615 million from ADB, 430 million from Japan and 140 million from IDB. In 2010 expenditure of the bridge was fixed at 2,972 million dollars or Tk 20,507 crore.</p>

                <h3>Economic impact:</h3>
                <p>The construction of the bridge will have a huge economic impact on the country. In an analysis or study report by Maunsell, the bridge's design consultant, in 2010, the bridge's Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) was 1.6 per cent and the Economic Internal Rate of Return (ERR) was 18 per cent. Add the cost of bridge construction. The BCR will be 2.1 and ERR 22 per cent. In other words, construction of this bridge will be economically profitable. Dhaka's communication with 21 southern districts will be reduced by 2 to 4 hours. The direct connectivity with the capital will help expand trade and commerce, ease supply of raw materials and industrialization. Small and big industries will be set up in the 21 districts. Agriculture will greatly improve. Farmers will get better commodity prices. Production will increase.</p>

                <h3>Toll rate of Padma bridge:</h3>
                <p>All countries have toll collection rules to cover the cost of any bridge or installation. Even if it is a bridge with its own financing or loan, there is no way for a big project to go without collecting toll. Tolls of small bridges are still being collected in our country which should not be done. The only large and national installations see toll collection in different countries of the world. Therefore, it is okay that toll for the bridge will be collected from the Padma Bridge. However, how much it will be, how it will be, for how many years this cost will be recovered, etc. are the issues of discussion. The bridge department has signed an agreement involving Tk 299 billion (29,900 crore) with the ministry to meet the cost of the Padma Bridge. The bridge department will repay the loan in 140 instalments over a period of 35 years at the rate of 1.0 per cent. Therefore, the toll has to be collected in such a way that the loan money and all the expenses for the maintenance of the bridge can be borne from the toll.</p>
